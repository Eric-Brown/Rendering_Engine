# Morphing

Xforming from one modell to another.

## Problems

Vertex  correspondannce

Interpolation

## How to

Just linearly interpolate betweeen two models

Can use difference vectors along with weights. 
Will allow like "happpy" face with "sad" eyebrows 

Pose space deformation. cmbienes vertex blendinng and morpph targets.
can use tessallation to get high res mesh withouut expensive skinning every vertex.
